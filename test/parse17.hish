Please stop stating bullshit. The only people banned for anything leak related are those uploading images from it or posting links to it. There’s an entire thread going on to discuss the content of the leak, plus images like this and others.

As for the movie, excuse me for wanting to keep the site running (and myself not sued for more than I have) because some people can’t help themselves from posting screencaps from a <b>stolen movie file.</b>

Well! It’s not every day that the guy who owns Derpibooru accuses me of committing a crime. But apparently <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1832">it is a crime</a> to possess a copy of a leaked file, even if you did nothing to break into the company’s servers, engaged in no deceit or subterfuge, and didn’t cost the company a single dime. Even though I went to the movie theater, and paid money for a ticket to see the movie, supposedly the fact that it’s “leaked” makes it illegal to even have the data. Not even child porn has restrictions as harsh as that!

The law even sort of sneakily states that it’s stolen, in the sense that the wording of the law assumes we already agreed it was stealing, without anyone actually agreeing on that. But no matter how the law lies, it is <i>physically</i> impossible to be stolen, because Hasbro still have all the data that was copied. The only argument for it being a crime might be that it was some form of espionage, but there’s no reason to incriminate people who just saw the results, and didn’t help commit it at all.

So why is it a crime? Because the legal system’s broken, you’re stupid for trusting the law, and law itself has been rendered bunk by an out-of-control wealth disparity. Back in the 90’s, big media went absolutely nuts about “the hacker menace” to the point of literal raving lunacy, because they were trying to scare and confuse us, in order to sneak laws through Congress that took away people’s freedoms. Once again, they wanted to use our (largely) tax funded police force to attack the people they’re supposed to be protecting, in order to protect private corporate interests.

And it worked like a charm.

It’s true that when stuff people work hard on leaks out before they’re ready, they’ve a right to be upset. I could accept that “harming a company by stealing secrets” is a crime, if the law wasn’t passed in the sneakiest most un-democratic way possible, with big corporate news media going all out to scare people into not protesting, and come on, “Title 18 Part 1 Chapter 90?” Tell me that’s not the name of a bill that they’re trying to sneak past us by being boring, because they know people’d put up a huge outcry if they realized they were gonna get branded criminals just for being in the vicinity of a crime.

Of course the people who made sharing (corporate secrets) illegal was none other than Ma Bell, the evil mind control corporation that teaches its employees that it is their moral duty to subjugate our wills, for our own good. Of course they’re calling themselves AT&amp;T nowadays, but all the illegal mergers that literally broke the law have pretty much reformed that phone giant into its former glory. And the owner of derpibooru is accusing <i>me</i> of being a criminal?

Remember that the law turns you into a criminal, for even talking about corporate secrets, whether or not you actually leaked them, the next time you hear about someone going to jail for a crime they supposedly “deserve.” Laws like this hurt the very fabric of society, because we can’t distrust criminals anymore, and we can’t trust those who presume to protect us. So many people (biased towards African Americans of course) are wrongfully imprisoned, whose sentence was massively disproportionate to their supposed “crime,” it’s a travesty.

And for the record I uh, totally uh, don’t have a copy of the leaked uh, movie so uh, if I post screenshots then I uh, got them from my secret buddy who I totally have over <a href="http://geti2p.net">i2p.</a>
